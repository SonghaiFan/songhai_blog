# Research Overview

My research focuses on enhancing human-data interaction through narrative visualization, immersive analytics, and AI-augmented frameworks. As a PhD candidate at Monash University, I work at the intersection of human-centered computing and advanced data visualization techniques.

## Research Areas

### Time-Track Narrative Graph Model (TTNG)

- Development of novel visualization methods for temporal data narratives
- Integration of graph-based approaches with narrative structures
- Implementation of LLM-powered Graph-to-Text pipelines
- User studies on algorithmic alignment with human narrative understanding

### Immersive Analytics & Scrollytelling

- Investigation of scrollytelling techniques for enhanced data engagement
- Development of immersive visualization frameworks
- Research on narrative coherence in interactive visualizations
- User experience studies in immersive data environments

### Human-AI Collaborative Systems

- Design of AI-augmented frameworks for data analysis
- Integration of LLMs in visualization workflows
- Research on human-AI interaction patterns
- Development of intelligent visualization assistants
