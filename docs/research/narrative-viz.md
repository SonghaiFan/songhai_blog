# Narrative Visualization

My research focuses on developing innovative approaches to data storytelling through narrative visualization techniques. This work explores how we can effectively combine data visualization with storytelling elements to create more engaging and understandable data presentations.

## Research Focus

### Data Storytelling Framework

- Development of structured approaches to narrative visualization
- Integration of temporal and causal relationships
- User engagement patterns in data stories
- Evaluation metrics for narrative effectiveness

### Current Projects

#### Interactive Storytelling Platform

- Development of web-based narrative visualization tools
- Integration of scrollytelling techniques
- User interaction analysis
- Impact measurement methodologies

#### Narrative Pattern Analysis

- Identification of effective narrative structures
- Pattern recognition in successful data stories
- Cross-domain application studies
- Best practices documentation
