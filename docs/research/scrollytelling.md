# Scrollytelling in Data Visualization

My research in scrollytelling explores how scroll-based interactions can enhance data visualization narratives and user engagement. This work combines principles from interaction design, narrative visualization, and cognitive psychology to create more immersive data experiences.

## Research Areas

### Interaction Design

- Scroll-based animation triggers
- Smooth transition techniques
- Visual hierarchy management
- Responsive design patterns

### Narrative Structure

- Story progression mapping
- Content pacing strategies
- Attention management
- Information layering

### User Experience

- Engagement metrics
- Cognitive load optimization
- Navigation patterns
- Accessibility considerations

## Technical Framework

### Implementation

```javascript
// Example Scrollytelling Setup
const scrolly = new ScrollyTeller({
  steps: story.sections,
  triggers: {
    enter: (step) => updateVisualization(step),
    progress: (step, progress) => animateTransition(progress),
    exit: (step) => cleanupStep(step),
  },
});
```

### Key Components

1. Scroll event handling
2. Animation management
3. State transitions
4. Performance optimization
