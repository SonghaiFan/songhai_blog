# Time-Track Narrative Graph Model (TTNG)

The Time-Track Narrative Graph Model is a novel approach to visualizing temporal narratives in data. This research project focuses on developing a comprehensive framework for representing and analyzing time-based narrative structures through graph-based visualization techniques.

## Research Overview

### Core Concepts

#### Graph Model

- Temporal node representation
- Narrative edge relationships
- Multi-dimensional connections
- Dynamic graph structures

#### Narrative Elements

- Story arc mapping
- Temporal progression
- Causal relationships
- Narrative patterns

## Technical Implementation

### Graph-to-Text Pipeline

- LLM integration for narrative generation
- Context-aware text synthesis
- Temporal coherence maintenance
- Narrative quality assessment

### Visualization Components

- Interactive timeline views
- Node-link representations
- Story path highlighting
- Dynamic filtering

## Current Research

### User Studies

- Algorithmic alignment with human understanding
- Cognitive load assessment
- Navigation pattern analysis
- Comprehension testing

### System Development

- Web-based visualization tools
- Real-time graph updates
